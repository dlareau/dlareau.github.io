      Taking random ideas I have and being able to make them real is something that I love doing.
      I've spent more than a good portion of my life taking apart, tinkering with, and eventually creating my own electronics.
      Since coming to college and getting a minor in computer science, I've also made a few large software projects.
      I have made a lot of things between all the free time I pour into my personal projects, 
      all the school time that I've had to develop projects for classes,
      and the numerous hackathons and other creation based events I've attended. 
      I hope to use this website to keep documentation and up to date info on all of these projects.
      It may take me a bit to get information backfilled on all of them, 
      but you can check out what I have a the moment <a href="/projects"> on my projects page </a>.

      Before coming to college, I had not played anything more interesting than Monopoly or The Game of Life. 
      Thankfully my good friends at the Carnegie Mellon University KGB pulled me into one of their board game nights early freshman year.
      After a round or two of Seven Wonders, Ticket to Ride, and a few other games I was hooked. 
      Now I'm playing games almost every weekend with my friends and have my own sizable library of games.
      You can check out my library and maybe in the future other stats <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/dlareau?own=1">over on board game geek</a>.

      I've loved puzzles for as long as I can remember, always being interested in things like crosswords, sudoku, and other brain teasers.
      When I got to college some of the upperclassmen I had become friends with were one person short for this event they called a "puzzlehunt".
      I had never heard of it before, but it had puzzle in the name, and was being run by the CMU KGB, so I figured how bad could it be? 
    <p>
    </p>
      I had such a great time that day that when they mentioned at the end that they needed staff members to write puzzles, I ended up joining. 
      During my time at CMU I wrote over a dozen puzzles that were used in puzzlehunts, attended many other hunts like Palantir Puzzlehunt and Google Games,
      <a href="https://github.com/dlareau/puzzlehunt_server">wrote the current webserver infrastructure,</a>
      helped the organization re-brand from KGB Puzzlehunt to PuzzlehuntCMU, and help the organization become recognized by the university.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that I've graduated I've switched mainly to just <a href="https://github.com/dlareau/puzzlehunt_server/issues"> maintaining the puzzlehunt server</a>,
      and attending other events such as 
      <a href="http://www.puzzledpint.com/"> Puzzled Pint,</a>
      <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posthunt/"> Washington Post Hunt,</a> and
      <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/"> the MIT Mystery Hunt</a>.
