I'm alive!

While I think I'll still make my goal of 12 posts a year, I've definitely missed the mark on my metric of 1 post per month that I was expecting when I started this blog. Part of the reason I wanted to start this blog even if nobody really reads it is to document the cool things that happen in my life and the day to day projects I tackle. To make sure that happens, I'm going to hopefully start writing for this blog regularly again as well as fill in some backlog of the interesting things that have happened to me during the hiatus. Over the next few days keep an eye out for posts about roadtrips, new houses, past projects, future projects, and other big life events.
