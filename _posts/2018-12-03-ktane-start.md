Idea generation and supplies gathering

**A disclaimer: There is not now, nor will there ever be anything dangerous 
about this project. This is not actually a bomb, just a game replica.**

If you're reading this and don't know about this project or the game *Keep 
Talking and Nobody Explodes* you should check out either the 
[project page](/projects/KTANE_physical) or the 
[announcement post](/blog/2018/07/07/ktane).

### The Idea ###
I don't remember exactly how the idea wormed it's way into my head. The earliest
record I have of the project is a note from July of 2017 that lists some of the
possible future projects I could do, one of which is just "KTANE". At the time I
dismissed the idea as being infeasible because I had a shockingly small room in
a 3 person apartment, and no space to really work on projects. 

Jumping forward to November of 2017, I had moved into a bigger apartment with a
basement workshop, started my first job after college, and used used my new
income to set up a decent [electronics workbench](/blog/2018/03/22/workbench).
The real tipping point though was the decision to purchase a 3d printer. Once I
had a printer on the way, I started looking over my list of possible projects to
see what I could use it for and this project jumped out at me. Finally! I had a
way to make the front plates and other interface aspects! 

This particular aspect was really important to me, I wanted this experience to
feel like you had been pulled into the game. The modules should look as similar
as possible, and the whole thing should be completely and easily reconfigurable.
Before I had access to a 3d printer I felt that my only options to achieve these
goals would be really clever laser cutting or sculpting, neither of which I
wanted to deal with. 

### Planning it out ###

Nearly immediately after ordering the printer, I started planning out the
modules. 
- pricing
- sketch
- which modules
- which aren't possible
- which mods looked good
- oh shit, I2c
- cost per module


### Getting the parts ###

- Printer arrived in February
- Sat on my ass till June
- Creative Reuse briefcase
