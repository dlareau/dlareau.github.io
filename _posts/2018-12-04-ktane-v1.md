**A disclaimer: There is not now, nor will there ever be anything dangerous 
about this project. This is not actually a bomb, just a game replica.**

If you're reading this and don't know about this project or the game *Keep 
Talking and Nobody Explodes* you should check out either the 
[project page](/projects/KTANE_physical) or the 
[announcement post](/blog/2018/07/07/ktane).
