The workspace I've always wanted.

This is gonna be a bit of a short post. I considered just lumping it in with another post, but given that I  
A) Have progress photos  
B) Am proud of this project  
C) Really want to show it off  
I can't not write a post about it.

Growing up, I always was envious of my dad's workshop. Everything you would want when doing a project was right nearby, the best part of working in his shop was the having a nice, clear, solid work surface. During the time I lived in my last apartment, I basically resolved that as soon as it was feasible, I was going to get my own really nice workspace. 

Imagine my joy when the new apartment we moved into had a ton of open space in the basement for such a project. The basement isn't a finished basement, which is totally fine, except for the fact that the floor is really not level. So with the help of my housemate Ethan, we drafted up the plans for the "perfect work area", all built around a nice desk-top we found while moving one of our friends out of their old apartment.

So, one trip to home depot later, we have the materials and we start building:
